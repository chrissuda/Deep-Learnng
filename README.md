# Deep-Learning

## Abstract
This project aims to classify accessibility feature of storefront on sidewalk from google street view images and it can help visually impaired people to avoid dangerous obstacles in the street and allow them to access each store. We are conducting some experiments on Faster-RCNN, a popular architecture in Object Detection. It enables us to have better understanding of how this model actually “sees” a physical object. 

## Dataset
#### We aims to identify 4 type of categories(excluding Backgroudn) as following.  
Training Data:   928 images with labels  
Validation Data: 100 images with labels  
Category:
* Background(0)
* Door(1)
* Knob(2)
* Stairs(3)
* Ramp(4)
